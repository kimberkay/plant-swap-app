8:05am - 9:00: Work in Figma to brainstorm how users might want to query the API so I can figure out what key words and info to include in my API


9:00 - 10:00: Research if possible to send over more than one ingredient at a time to swap for an API query

10:15 - 11:00: Create Google Sheet to start entering data and plant subs for my API. Still contemplating best way to organize the queries. Also, researching Walmart in various mid-West/non-Portland cities to understand what kind of products are available in other parts of the country. Portland has a lot to offer vegans, I want to offer everyone the ability to find subs.

1:15 - 2:30 Work in GoogleSheets to populate API

8:15pm - Talked over my project with a friend last night, while talking through what I planned to do with her I finally figured out how to structure my swaps. Working now in GoogleSheets to restructure my API.

9:10pm- Restructured and added swaps to API.

Feb-24-22

8:30 - 9:00 Added columns to google sheets before getting ready to import csv into mySqul. Sheets need a lot of work (entries) but I finally have a good structure to follow. Will import sheet today to create table but will end up filling in many, many more swaps and re-importing the csv again.
